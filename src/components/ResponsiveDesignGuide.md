# Bounce Kingdom Ghana - Responsive Design Guide

## Overview
This guide outlines the responsive design principles and implementation strategies for the Bounce Kingdom Ghana website. The site is designed to work seamlessly across all device sizes with a mobile-first approach.

## Breakpoints
The website uses the following responsive breakpoints:

1. **Small Mobile**: Up to 480px
2. **Mobile**: Up to 768px
3. **Tablet**: Up to 1024px
4. **Desktop**: 1025px and above

## Responsive Components

### 1. Responsive Grid
- Uses CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for flexible layouts
- Adapts from 1 column on mobile to multiple columns on desktop
- Includes utility classes for specific column counts on different devices

### 2. Responsive Cards
- Flexible containers with hover effects
- Adjust padding, border-radius, and shadows based on screen size
- Include variants for different color schemes

### 3. Responsive Buttons
- Touch-friendly minimum sizes (44px) on mobile
- Scale padding and font size based on device
- Multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline) with consistent styling

### 4. Responsive Images
- Always maintain aspect ratio
- Use object-fit for proper scaling
- Include lazy loading for performance

### 5. Mobile Navigation
- Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- Slide-in navigation panel
- Overlay background when menu is open

## Typography Scaling
- Base font size adjusts based on screen size
- Headings scale proportionally
- Line heights adjusted for readability on all devices

## Spacing System
- Consistent spacing using rem units
- Responsive spacing that reduces on smaller screens
- Utility classes for padding and margin at different breakpoints

## Touch Targets
- All interactive elements have minimum 44px touch targets
- Adequate spacing between interactive elements
- Hover states converted to tap states on touch devices

## Performance Considerations
- Lazy loading for images
- CSS containment for complex components
- Efficient media queries
- Minimal JavaScript for responsive behavior

## Testing Guidelines
1. Test on actual devices when possible
2. Use browser dev tools for initial testing
3. Check all breakpoints for layout issues
4. Verify touch interactions on mobile
5. Test with various text sizes and zoom levels

## Implementation Notes
- All components use mobile-first CSS
- Media queries use max-width for breakpoints
- Utility classes available for common responsive patterns
- Components are designed to be composable and reusable

## Best Practices
1. Always test responsive behavior during development
2. Use relative units (rem, %, em) instead of fixed pixels
3. Optimize images for different screen densities
4. Prioritize content for mobile experiences
5. Ensure accessibility is maintained across all devices
