- Proper fallback values for all configuration options
- Documentation for environment variable setup

### Documentation
✅ **PASSED** - Comprehensive documentation available
- README.md updated with production deployment instructions

### Assets
✅ **PASSED** - All assets properly configured
- Favicon and manifest files included

## Deployment Readiness

The application is ready for deployment to any Node.js hosting environment with these requirements:
- Node.js version 18 or higher
- MongoDB database (local or cloud-based)
- Ability to set environment variables

## Deployment Steps

1. Clone repository to production server
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Configure `.env.production` with actual values:
   - Replace placeholder MongoDB URI with actual connection string
   - Replace placeholder JWT secret with strong secret key
4. Build application with `npm run build`
5. Start server with `npm start`
6. Application will be available on port 5000 (or PORT specified in environment)

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify these endpoints:
- Health check: `GET /health` should return 200 OK with JSON status
- Main application: `GET /` should return 200 OK with HTML content
