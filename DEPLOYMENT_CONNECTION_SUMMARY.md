# Bounce Kingdom Ghana - Frontend to Backend Connection Summary

## Current Status
✅ Backend is live and accessible
✅ Frontend builds successfully
✅ Environment variables are properly configured

## Configuration Summary

### Backend (Render.com)
- URL: `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com`
- Status: ✅ Running

### Frontend (Netlify) - To be configured
- Environment Variable: `VITE_API_URL=https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com`

## Required Actions for Full Deployment

### 1. Configure Netlify Environment Variables
1. Go to your Netlify site dashboard
2. Navigate to "Site settings" → "Build & deploy" → "Environment"
3. Add the following environment variable:
   - Key: `VITE_API_URL`
   - Value: `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com`

### 2. Trigger a New Deployment
1. After setting the environment variable, trigger a new deployment in Netlify
2. This ensures the frontend is built with the correct backend URL

### 3. Verify the Connection
1. After deployment, visit your site
2. Test the connection using the connection test page at `/connection-test.html`
3. Or check the browser's Network tab to see API requests being made to your backend

## Technical Details

### How the Connection Works
1. **Development**: 
   - Frontend runs on `http://localhost:5173`
   - API requests to `/api/*` are proxied to `http://localhost:5001` (configured in vite.config.js)

2. **Production**:
   - Frontend is served from Netlify
   - `VITE_API_URL` environment variable determines the backend URL
   - All API requests are made directly to `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com`

### Files Verified
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - Proxy configuration updated to port 5001
- ✅ `server.js` - Backend configured to run on port 5001
- ✅ `.env` - Development environment variables
- ✅ `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- ✅ `src/services/productService.js` - Uses `import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL` correctly
- ✅ Build process - Completes successfully

## Testing the Connection

### Automated Testing
1. Run `node test_backend_connection_fixed.js` to test local connection
2. Deploy `/connection-test.html` to test production connection

### Manual Testing
1. Visit your deployed site
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Network tab
4. Refresh the page
5. Look for requests to:
   - `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com/api/products`
   - `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com/api/bookings`
   - `https://bounce-kingdom-backend-app.onrender.com/api/reports`

## Troubleshooting

### If Connection Fails
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly in Netlify
2. Check that your backend is running and accessible
3. Ensure CORS is enabled on your backend (already configured)
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Check network tab for failed requests

### Common Issues
1. **Environment variables not taking effect**: Trigger a new deployment
2. **CORS errors**: Should be resolved with current configuration
3. **404 errors**: Verify API endpoints exist on backend
4. **500 errors**: Check backend logs for errors

## Next Steps
1. Set `VITE_API_URL` environment variable in Netlify
2. Trigger a new deployment
3. Test the connection
4. Verify all functionality works (product management, bookings, reports, activities)

## Support
If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify network requests in the Network tab
3. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set
4. Confirm the backend is running and accessible
